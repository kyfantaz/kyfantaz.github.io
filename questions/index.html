<ul>
<li><p>How does one robustly debug when your maching learning model is not training well or has undesirable behavior? How does one encourage a model to explore a specific part of the state space? How does one know your model has done well sampling the whole search space (and not stuck in a local optima). What are good ways of describing that?</p></li>

<li><p>Current deep learning methods have had promising results by learning feature hierarchies such that features from higher levels of hierarchy are formed by the composition of lower level features, but only when trained end-to-end and within a single model. How do we make models themselves composable? How do we fundamentally architect a system of composable models?</p></li>
